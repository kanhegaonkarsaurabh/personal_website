I sit here on the [7:50, late Sunday night] Amtrak from Simi Valley to Solona Beach, fighting off the urge to title this post "Hello World!". 
The Thursday night prior I had followed a quick tutorial on setting up Jekyll blogs after exploring the right medium for publication. 

I'm just going to write whatever comes into my head. I'm starting out writing after a long time of not doing it all the time. 
From what I remember, the best thing to do in these situtaions is never let yourself stop writing, then revise. 
Writing is a lot like agile development I guess. It's all about iteration. All this is is the first pass. 

I wanted to talk about some of the decisions and thought about how this website came to be. I wounder if this is even a good subject for a first post. 
Let's see if it's interesting shall we? 
Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about it was so that I could talk about the design decisions that occured in the construction of the medium. 
Specifically, I wanted to talk about my old website and why (how)? I'm transitioning to this website. 

I have a deep passion for software. I love coding. I get to do it for work, I spend time programming at home, I read hacker news and r/programming, and often dream about programming problesm. 
I've always wanted a blog, ever since I was little. When I was younger, I first got into coding through Flash web design. I would so much of my free time at the age of 13 and 14 on FlashPerfection.com, taking tutorials on actionscript and animation. I wanted to be a web designer when i grew up. 
I was obsessed with fractals and light sabers and line art, and flash was a way where I could create movies through time, animations, interactiven websites. 
(What I wanted to get on about was...) I even created a few tutorials on FlashPerfection from what I have learned. 
I gained a lot of pride from making those and had however many views. What I really wanted to be is some sort of web guru, the kind of people that could do more than copy, paste, adapt, repeat. 
I wanted a way to be the person that had the original ideas that people built other ideas on top of, to create code from scratch instead of [being a script kiddie].

I love creating tutorials. Writing down a procedure on how to craft something was a great way to consolidate what I knew and further prove that it amounted to something. 
It felt good coming up with ideas and publishing them.



Since this is my first post, and I don't know really what this space is, I want to set some intentions for what this blog could be. 

I want to rediscover the joy of creating and sharing I once knew. 
 
Shit, I realize right now that it's literally been about ten years since I first published my tutorials. 
There are a lot of parallents between me then and me now. I was relatively new to a field, having just learned about flash and actionscript at a summer camp, yet had a willingness to contribute back to a community of learning. 
I was certainly not an expert, but I had the beginners mindset, which put me in a good position to teach. 

Right now, in many ways, I am a bigger. I am only a year out of university, in my first "real job" with the field of software engineering.
And I am ready to share the occasional ideas I have.
