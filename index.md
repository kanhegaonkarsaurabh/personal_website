# Hey, I'm Saurabh Kanhegaonkar!

I'm currently a rising junior at UC San Diego and am pursuing BS in Computer Science. I'm interested in building backend systems, designing data and AI pipelines and anything that involves software design and engineering!

I'm currently a summer software engineering intern at [Aira](https://aira.io/), a remote assistance platform for visually impaired people.

You can check out my public profiles and if you want to chat about anything, reach out to me [here]().
